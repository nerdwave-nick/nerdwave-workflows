# Building and installing lit

The service supports Linux amd64/arm64 with local filesystem storage. The client
supports Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64. Linux behavior
is tested; cross-compilation does not demonstrate native macOS/Windows behavior.
Python is not required to build, install, or run the binaries and workflow skills.

## Standard Go build and install

Install Go matching `go.mod` (1.24 or later). From the repository root:

```sh
go build -o ./bin/ ./cmd/lit-server ./cmd/lit  # Linux: create both executables
go install ./cmd/lit-server ./cmd/lit         # Linux: install checkout versions
```

On macOS or Windows, build/install only `./cmd/lit`. Separate commands such as
`go build ./cmd/lit` also work and leave the executable in the current directory.
Installation uses `GOBIN`, or `GOPATH/bin` when unset (normally `$HOME/go/bin`).
Check `go env GOBIN GOPATH` and add the appropriate directory to PATH yourself;
installation does not edit your shell profile.

Once this module has been published and is accessible, installation without a
checkout uses an explicit version query:

```sh
go install github.com/nerdwave-nick/nerdwave-workflows/cmd/lit@latest
# Linux service, if needed:
go install github.com/nerdwave-nick/nerdwave-workflows/cmd/lit-server@latest
```

Replace `latest` with a published tag to pin a version. Remote publication and
installation availability have not been verified; these commands describe the
supported Go interface, not an already published release.

## Install embedded workflow skills

The installed CLI contains the sixteen workflow skills and their instruction
template. Setup is offline and needs no source checkout or tracker connection:

```sh
lit setup-skills --scope local --agent both
lit setup-skills --scope user --agent codex
lit setup-skills --scope custom --path /path/to/project --agent claude
```

Both `--scope` and `--agent` are required. Agent values are `codex`, `claude`, or
`both`. Local scope uses the current working directory, including a worktree;
user scope uses the user's home directory. Custom scope requires `--path` pointing
to the **parent containing `.codex` and/or `.claude`**, not either host directory
itself. `--path` is rejected for local/user scope. Setup does not walk to a Git
root or redirect using vendor configuration environment variables.

Setup manages files under the selected host directories, preserving unrelated
content. Rerun it after a CLI upgrade to update owned skills. Unmanaged collisions
and local edits are errors, not permission to overwrite. Both-agent setup preflights
both destinations before writing; an unexpected filesystem failure can leave one
host updated, since the two hosts are separate transactions. Correct the reported
problem and rerun for safe recovery. Setup does not start the service, establish
tracker identity, or enable paid consultations. Setup writes a JSON installation
receipt; it does not accept `--format`. If writing that receipt fails, it exits
nonzero and reports that skills were installed. The completed installation stays
in place; the output error does not roll it back. See the installed lit skill's host
reference for explicit session setup.

## Release archives

CI cross-builds seven binaries across five targets: Linux amd64/arm64 archives
contain `lit-server` and `lit`; macOS amd64/arm64 and Windows amd64 archives contain
only `lit` (`lit.exe` on Windows). All archives contain `INSTALL.md`; Linux
archives also contain the optional `lit.service.in` template and `lit.socket` unit. Skills are embedded
in the client, so no separate installer or Python program is included.

Pull requests run Go race tests, vet, and cross-builds. Version tags
(`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, optionally `-PRERELEASE`) additionally produce five archives
and `SHA256SUMS` as GitHub Actions artifacts. CI uses ordinary Go commands and
shell archive utilities; it does not create GitHub Releases. Publishing remains
an explicit separate action. CI embeds the release identifier in `lit-server --version`
and `lit version`; source builds without that override report `dev`.

Verify checksums before extracting: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` on Linux,
`shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` on macOS, or compare PowerShell
`Get-FileHash .\lit-v0.1.0-windows-amd64.zip -Algorithm SHA256` with its checksum
entry. Download all listed archives for a full checksum check, or select the
entry matching your archive. Copy extracted binaries to a directory on PATH.
No custom build or binary installation tool is necessary.

## Start and stop explicitly

On Linux:

```sh
lit-server
```

The initial service accepts only a loopback IP listener, such as
`127.0.0.1:7411` or `[::1]:7411`. Wildcard/public IP addresses and hostnames
(including `localhost`) are rejected. Remote hosting is a future design goal,
not a supported listener mode in this delivery.

The process runs in the foreground. Stop it with Ctrl-C or SIGTERM. Shutdown
allows active work up to thirty seconds. Logs go to stderr; record contents are
not dumped. An occupied port fails without selecting another port. CLI commands
do not start the service. Use `lit --help` for the installed command surface.

Default configuration: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/lit-server/config.json`.
Default data: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lit-server`. Relative XDG values are
ignored in favor of HOME defaults. Missing default configuration uses defaults;
explicitly selecting a missing file is an error. An optional JSON file is:

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "data_dir": "/home/alice/.local/share/lit-server", "listen": "127.0.0.1:7411"}
```

Use absolute paths in configuration. Precedence is command flags, environment,
JSON, defaults:

| Flag | Environment | JSON field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config` | `LIT_CONFIG_FILE` | selects the file |
| `--data-dir` | `LIT_DATA_DIR` | `data_dir` |
| `--listen` | `LIT_LISTEN` | `listen` |

Changes require an explicit restart. Invalid/unknown configuration fields and
unsupported format versions fail clearly. First explicit startup initializes an
empty store under exclusive ownership; populated damaged stores do not gain a
fabricated identity. Keep storage together and preserve it when replacing binaries.
The client uses separate private state. `LIT_STATE_DIR` overrides these defaults:

| Platform | Client state directory |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/lit` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/lit` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lit` |

Workflow records default to the `local` subdirectory of each platform's client
state directory above. `LIT_WORKFLOW_STATE_DIR` overrides that location independently
of `LIT_STATE_DIR`. Neither location is the service data directory.

## Connect a client

With `lit-server` running on its default listener:

```sh
lit connect --session poc-human --actor-name Alex --actor-kind human
lit projects list --session poc-human
```

To capture the logical session name in Fish without replacing the current
selection if connection fails:

```fish
set -l lit_session (lit connect --session-id-only)
and set -gx LIT_SESSION "$lit_session"
```

For Bash or Zsh:

```sh
lit_session=$(lit connect --session-id-only) && export LIT_SESSION="$lit_session"
```

`--session-id-only` prints only the logical name and a newline on success, even
with `--format json` or a saved Markdown preference. Errors and warnings stay on
stderr. The flag does not itself change saved output preferences. Session selection
still honors `--session` and `LIT_SESSION`, so an existing exported session is reused.

Logical session selection is `--session NAME` > `LIT_SESSION`. An explicitly
supplied empty `--session` is invalid; omit the flag to use the fallback. With neither,
`lit connect` creates a fresh isolated client under a random
`throwaway-<UUID>` name. The response shows **Logical session** in CLI/Markdown
and `items[0].logical_session` in JSON. Reuse that complete name with `--session`
on later calls (or set `LIT_SESSION`); other tracker commands require a session.
No session is automatically selected for the shell, and “throwaway” does not mean
auto-deleted: the mapping remains available for deliberate reuse. Explicit
`--session default` still resumes an existing legacy mapping. `--client-id UUID`
can explicitly attach a new logical name to an existing client instead of
registering a fresh client. `version`, help/completion, and local
`transactions status` do not require a selected logical session.

If registration succeeds but saving the local mapping fails, the
`local_state_error` includes `logical_session`, `client_id`, `service_id`, and
`endpoint` in its JSON `error.details`, and prints a recovery command. Repair
the reported local filesystem problem, then reconnect using that session name,
client ID, and endpoint to retain the registered client instead of creating another.

Client endpoint precedence is `--endpoint` > `LIT_ENDPOINT` > the selected
session's remembered endpoint > `http://127.0.0.1:7411`. A first local connection
therefore needs no endpoint flag. Remote connections can use
`--endpoint https://tracker.example.com`; saved remote sessions keep that endpoint
unless explicitly overridden. Invalid selected endpoints are rejected without
falling back, and a changed service identity is still rejected as `wrong_service`.
The client never starts the service or falls back after a connection failure.

`workflow-session fresh` and `workflow-session subagent` use `--endpoint`, then
`LIT_ENDPOINT`, then the same loopback default. `resume`, `reconcile`, and `run`
keep the endpoint and identity saved in their runtime association, even when the
shell's `LIT_ENDPOINT` changes.

## Optional systemd user service

The checked-in `packaging/lit.service.in` (also in Linux archives) is a template,
not an installed unit. To opt into service operation, copy it to
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/systemd/user/lit.service` and edit it manually:

- Replace `@EXEC_START@` with the absolute path to your installed `lit-server`,
  for example `/home/alice/go/bin/lit-server`. Quote executable paths
  containing spaces with double quotes using systemd unit syntax.
- Remove `@ENVIRONMENT@`, or replace it with explicit `Environment=` lines for
  the configuration/data settings you want the service to use.
- Review configuration and permissions. A user manager may have different
  environment variables than your shell, so make custom paths explicit. An
  explicitly selected configuration file must already exist before startup.

The unit allows thirty seconds of graceful shutdown plus five seconds for exit.
Once reviewed, choose service operation explicitly:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start lit.service
systemctl --user status lit.service
journalctl --user -u lit.service
systemctl --user stop lit.service
```

Login-time enablement is a separate `systemctl --user enable lit.service`
decision. No persistent service, lingering, or machine-wide configuration is
installed or enabled automatically.

### Optional socket activation

Instead of running `lit-server` continuously, systemd can hold the listening
socket and start the service on the first connection. Install the service unit
as above, then copy `packaging/lit.socket` (also in Linux archives) beside it as
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/systemd/user/lit.socket`. Its `ListenStream=`
is the default `127.0.0.1:7411`; edit it to change the address.

While socket-activated, the socket's address replaces the configured listener:
`--listen`, `LIT_LISTEN`, and the JSON `listen` field are still validated but not
bound. The inherited socket must be exactly one loopback TCP listener. Anything else,
such as a wildcard or public address, a Unix socket path, several `Listen*` lines,
or `Accept=yes`, is unsupported; the service exits with an error rather than
serving it. The log reports
`lit-server listening ADDRESS (socket-activated)`.

Enable the socket, not the service:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now lit.socket
systemctl --user status lit.socket lit.service
```

The `lit` client is unchanged and still never starts the service itself; its
first connection to the socket causes systemd to start `lit-server`. The service
does not exit when idle; it keeps running until stopped. Stopping only
`lit.service` leaves the socket listening, so the next connection starts it
again. To turn activation off, run `systemctl --user disable --now lit.socket`
and stop `lit.service`.

## Manual updates

Stop the foreground service or user service before replacing its executable.
With socket activation, stop `lit.socket` as well as `lit.service`, so that a
client connection cannot start the old executable during replacement.
Run `go install` again for the chosen source/version, or verify and extract the
chosen archive and copy its binaries. Rerun `lit setup-skills` with the same
scope/agent/path selection to update the installed skill bundle. Review any
reported local edits before proceeding. Explicitly restart the service afterward
(with socket activation, start `lit.socket` again).
Service identity and records remain in the existing data directory. Unsupported
persisted formats are refused without conversion; there is no automatic updater
or tracker migration tool.

## Local checks

```sh
go test -count=1 -race ./...
go vet ./...
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/linux-arm64/ ./cmd/lit-server ./cmd/lit
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ./bin/darwin-arm64/ ./cmd/lit
```

The workflow in `.github/workflows/lit.yml` contains the full accepted matrix
and archive commands. To verify its generated artifacts locally:

```sh
LIT_ARCHIVE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/dist LIT_ARCHIVE_VERSION=v0.1.0 go test -count=1 -v ./packaging
```

The archive check verifies all five checksums, exact archive contents, executable
permissions, and (on Linux amd64) versions from the actual archived executables.
It does not start or enable systemd or claim native non-Linux runtime validation.

## Consultation skill

`consult` is included in the embedded skills. Agents use it to invoke a separately
installed Claude or Codex CLI directly; there is no `lit consult` command.
The skill guides exact model/effort selection, explicit session reuse, read-only
permissions and agent-managed discussion notes. Coordination is followed by the
agent rather than enforced by a helper. Existing consultation JSON records,
locks and vendor transcripts are preserved as evidence; no migration or deletion
is performed. Rerun `setup-skills` after updating the CLI to install this revision.

## Output formats

Tracker commands accept `--format cli|markdown|json`. The default `cli` format
uses terminal tables and labeled details. `markdown` produces document-ready
Markdown, including readable tables. `json` retains the machine-readable result
and error envelopes. Piping does not change the selected format.

```sh
lit projects list --session poc-human
lit projects list --session poc-human --format markdown > projects.md
lit projects list --session poc-human --format json
lit session set --session poc-human --output-format cli
```

`--format` affects one invocation on ordinary commands. `connect --output-format`
and `session set --output-format` save the session preference. For compatibility,
`connect --format` also saves that format when `--output-format` is absent; with
both flags, `--output-format` controls persistence and `--format` controls display. A session without a
saved preference uses `cli`. Existing saved `human` preferences and checkout
caches render as `cli` without changing client IDs, state revisions or storage
versions. The service continues accepting legacy `human` values for old API
clients, while new CLI flags and completions offer only the three public names.
JSON responses retain the stored preference verbatim, including legacy `human`.

Errors before contacting the service use an explicit `--format`, otherwise the
matching checkout cache. Without either, offline/bootstrap errors retain the
JSON fallback so scripts can still inspect the error code. A cache for another
service/client or unsupported cache version is ignored.
