# lit core development

The executable paths are `cmd/lit-server` and `cmd/lit` in the module
`github.com/nerdwave-nick/nerdwave-workflows`. Run `go test -race ./...` for the public
CLI / real service suite and focused persistence, protocol, and HTTP tests.
See [verification](testing.md) for the full validation commands.
The integration harness builds race-instrumented executable binaries into a
removed temporary directory and uses temporary data, private client state, and
working directories. It never starts a persistent service or consults vendors.

`lit-server` reads strict version-1 JSON configuration. Flags override environment,
which overrides JSON, which overrides defaults. The listener defaults to
`127.0.0.1:7411`. An explicitly selected missing configuration is an error.
The service holds its Linux OS lock before automatic recovery and releases it
only after HTTP shutdown has drained storage work. SIGINT and SIGTERM allow up
to thirty seconds; exceeding that bound terminates and leaves replay evidence.

Ticket 01 provides connect, disconnect, and the available session properties.
Project references need ticket 02's project resolver; no project is invented by
setting a session field. Disconnect releases the client’s active claims in the same atomic storage
operation as the client transition.
Deferred archives, editing windows, drafts, and saved plans have no routes.

## Extension interfaces

- `internal/protocol` holds public types, strict request/persisted JSON decoding,
  stable errors, UUID generation, and HTTP envelopes. Response decoding is
  intentionally additive; unknown successful mutation outcomes retain pending
  evidence. Add canonical durable encoding here with the projects slice.
- `internal/store.Store` owns the directory, identity, OS lock, and redo journal.
  `Commit([]Write)` atomically establishes one batch's commitment and replays its
  fixed bytes. `JSONWrite` is a convenience for versioned envelopes. Durable
  object slices can write Markdown and relationship/history files through the
  same batch. Paths are store-relative and cannot target identity or journal
  machinery. The store fences externally changed authoritative files; it never
  accepts silent repairs. Derived-index rebuilding belongs to its owning slice.
- `Store.Fault` is a narrow in-process test seam for journal boundaries:
  `after_journal_directory`, `after_payload`, `before_commit`, `after_commit`,
  `after_write:N`, `cleanup_after_marker`, and `cleanup_after_payload`. It is not
  enabled by production environment variables. A fault poisons further writes
  until the store is reopened. `OpenWithFault` additionally exercises interrupted
  startup replay; production startup never supplies it. Tests preserve exact replay bytes and service ID
  across two restarts, and reject damaged or symlink-directed evidence.
- `internal/service.Server.Mu` serializes logical reads and writes. Request-body
  network reads happen first; response bytes are materialized under the mutex and
  transmitted afterwards. Resource handlers belong in separate files and are
  dispatched from `route`. Mutations must check bounded success output before
  committing; never return a definite limit rejection after changing state.
- `internal/cli.App` holds arguments, client/service binding, deadline, output
  preference, and last observed service time. `Call` persists exact outgoing
  operational requests before transmission. Failed local persistence prevents
  sending. Uncertain transport or response results retain pending evidence and
  exit 4. Ticket 06 supplies complete operational reconciliation/status; this
  foundation deliberately never blindly replays a pending request.
- Resource CLI verbs should live in separate files, expanding argument validation
  and dispatch. Session selections are property selectors, distinct from the
  global project context used by later resource commands. Grouped resource flags
  need their own item-aware parsing; do not treat them as singleton session flags.

The CLI encodes local names under `sessions/`, uses an OS lock for each name,
and keeps exact requests in `pending/`. Every envelope has `schema_version: 1`.
The separate cwd `.lit/<client-id>/state.json` caches only output preference and
binding. A corrupt/mismatched cache grants no authority; offline output falls
back to JSON. Server-held project/output settings remain authoritative online.

Testing limitations: fault tests exercise deterministic filesystem boundaries and
reopening; they do not simulate a physical disk or power failure. Linux is the
service runtime boundary. Cross-compilation is not native macOS/Windows runtime
validation. The later build/install ticket owns release automation and installation.

## Durable projects and transaction extension points

Ticket 02 adds projects create/get/list/update/history, grouped arguments and JSON
files (including a single stdin consumer), exact selectors, session project
selection, and atomic semantic batches. The public CLI always prepares a mutation
before sending the exact returned typed intent/hash through its existing pending
writer. Preparation is an ordinary read; it creates no saved plan, reservation,
claim, or other durable state. Direct HTTP execution uses that exact returned
canonical descriptor rather than reconstructing fields. Optional outer transport
schema markers are accepted; persisted canonical intents and all application-owned
files carry version 1.

- `protocol.Intent`, `Operation`, `ObjectRef`, and `Canonical` define durable intent.
  Canonical fixtures in `internal/protocol/testdata` pin bytes and SHA-256 values,
  including Markdown escaping/CRLF, set/key order, and omitted versus clear fields.
  Extend the typed semantic fields and normalization together for issues/comments;
  never introduce arbitrary JSON mutation maps. Expand strict per-command presence
  validation when adding fields. Repeated compatible descriptors merge before
  canonical encoding, while duplicate members inside one input are invalid.
- `Server.PrepareProjects` resolves all selectors under the server mutex, merges
  semantic groups, fixes IDs/revisions, and validates the complete final state.
  `projectTransaction` returns journal writes plus changed-owner results without
  committing. Both preparation and execution use that engine. Later resource
  slices should extend the same complete-state validation/expansion boundary;
  project membership changes must participate as ordinary changed owners.
- `commitDurableResponse` constructs and checks the exact success bytes before
  committing. Reads and mutation responses are transmitted after `Server.Mu` is
  released. Durable HTTP results use `data.results`; CLI output uses `items`.
  List/snapshot/history pages use top-level HTTP `items` and `next_cursor`.
- Each project is `projects/<uuid>/content.md` plus `relationships.json`. The
  Markdown front matter is readable block YAML, preserving the description bytes
  after the closing delimiter. JSON and root flow-map metadata are unsupported;
  the service neither migrates nor deletes old test data. See
  [the storage format](../storage-format.md) for the strict metadata rules. Membership is stored only
  in the separate versioned relationship file. No direct source edits are accepted.
- `ProjectHistory` contains only changed metadata/membership before/after values,
  optional reversible whole-body replacement hunks, owner revisions, and the
  complete intent/result descriptor. Whole-body hunks favor simple lossless
  reconstruction over line-diff compression; they preserve all Markdown bytes.
  Files are immutable `history/<fixed-width-UTC-microseconds>-<hash>.json`.
  Time advances past the maximum accepted project timestamp even if the clock
  repeats or moves backward. Changed owners advance once; guards/no-ops do not.
- `InitProjects` reconstructs metadata/body history, validates canonical operations
  against differences and current sources, and checks matching results across
  every changed owner. Only then does it rebuild `indexes/titles.json`. Current
  titles use the configured prefix allowlist; historical titles may retain retired
  prefixes. When extending to issues, add authoritative membership validation and
  issue index generation here instead of overwriting their derived mappings.
- `ResolveProject`, `Project`, `Projects`, `ProjectHistory`, and the existing store
  API are the read seams for subsequent resource/discovery/reconciliation slices.
  UUID prefixes accept case-insensitive hex and standard-position hyphens. History
  detail/request outcome routes use UUID owners. Missing owner request lookup is
  `not_recorded_here`; it does not prove an entire batch failed.

Project tests exercise actual CLI binaries against a real temporary service,
including a proxy that drops a committed mutation's response. Pending evidence
retains its creation IDs/hash and owner history establishes the committed outcome.
Narrow storage tests interrupt before/after commitment, after each of seven files
in a two-project transaction, and during cleanup, then reopen twice. They check
complete content, membership, history and index, identity, and unchanged replay
bytes. These deterministic seams do not simulate physical power failure. Complete
interactive transaction reconciliation remains ticket 06's scope.

Successor slices must preserve canonical history hashes and supported YAML
record semantics. Add typed optional fields with omission rules that leave
canonical request bytes unchanged. The old project-only JSON frontmatter fixture
now verifies startup rejection without modification; it is not a compatibility
promise. YAML restart and mutation tests cover projects, issues and comments.

## Issues, comments, and shared record transactions

Ticket 03 adds `Issue` and `Comment` to `protocol`, with optional typed semantic
fields in the original `ProjectSet` / `ProjectMembers` / `ProjectInput` types.
Those retained names are source compatibility seams, not restrictions on resource
type. Canonical field omission preserves every project-only version-1 hash.
`Set.Assignee` and `Set.ParentID` are `**string`: nil outer pointer means omitted,
a nonnil outer pointer with nil value means explicit JSON null, and a string
value means assignment. Custom decoding preserves all three states. Input
`clear` is translated into those typed null fields; body clears are empty text.
All other null set values and inapplicable resource fields are rejected.

- `records.go` owns `Issue`, `Comment`, `Issues`, `Comments`, `Records`, exact
  resolvers, shared NFC/default-fold `IssueTitleKey`, and strict Markdown /
  relationship decoding. Metadata and relationship fields have distinct locations;
  a frontmatter body or misplaced membership is corruption, not an ignored field.
- `ReadRecordState` enumerates one accepted state under `Server.Mu`. The read
  helpers do not acquire the mutex themselves. HTTP and later discovery/grep
  handlers must hold it while collecting their complete snapshot.
- `record_transaction.go` is the shared complete-state engine used by project,
  issue, and comment preparation/execution. `finalState` applies typed operations,
  derives memberships from final ownership, then validates uniqueness and cycles.
  `requiredGuards` captures unchanged projects/owners/ancestors relied upon during
  resolution and structure validation. Explicit targets plus changed indirect
  owners are revision preconditions; guards never get revisions or history.
  Each changed owner advances once. Future relationship operations should extend
  typed operations and this engine, without introducing a second commit path.
- `recordTransaction` checks actor/service/client binding, revisions and expanded
  limits, produces validated writes/results, and leaves commitment to the existing
  bounded `commitDurableResponse`. Claims can add policy checks at this shared
  execution boundary before writes are produced; this slice invents no claims.
- `record_history.go` replays each entire historical semantic transaction against
  its pre-state, checks affected owners, guards, diffs, timestamps and result
  descriptors, and compares accepted authority. It reconstructs memberships using
  the same engine. Only then does it rebuild project and issue title indexes.
  `InitProjects` remains a compatibility wrapper around `InitRecords`.
- `record_http.go` extends the snapshot/query seam and resource routes. Basic
  issue lists require a project or explicit all-projects; comments require an
  owning issue. `ProjectQuery` retains its existing name and adds those scope
  fields, with strict field presence validation. Ticket 04 owns further discovery
  filters and links. Ticket 07 can use the same serialized enumeration for grep.
- `cli/records.go` owns grouped issue/comment arguments, JSON array/file/stdin
  inputs, mutation preparation and read commands. CLI mutation results remain
  `items`; HTTP mutation results remain `data.results`, and snapshot/list/history
  pages remain top-level `items` / `next_cursor`.

The literal `title:` selector consumes every remaining colon. A qualifying
project title scopes the following title or UUID prefix; unqualified UUID
prefixes remain global regardless of session project. Lookup, uniqueness and
index keys use the same Unicode normalization while preserving displayed titles
and all Markdown bytes. Parent updates stay in the owning project and retain
children; no move, archive, restore or deletion behavior was added.

## Claims and live execution policy

Ticket 05 keeps claims solely in version-1 `issues/<id>/claim.json` envelopes.
The required `claim` member is either a `protocol.Claim` or explicit null after
release. Expired claims never appear as live and never regain time on restart.
`Server.LiveClaim(id)` and `Server.Claims(ownerID)` are the serialized read seams;
call them under `Server.Mu`. HTTP handling captures one request time under that
mutex for claim filtering, ownership fencing, projections and success response
timestamps; a later request evaluates expiry anew. They validate the authoritative file, and startup
validates all claims including expired records. Discovery must use these seams.

`claimTransaction` validates and returns operational writes; HTTP materializes
and bounds the exact response before the one journal commit. `POST /v1/operations`
accepts `protocol.ClaimOperation` for atomic acquire/renew/release batches;
`selection: all_owned` fences the complete live ID/token set. Singular issue
claim routes use that engine. `POST /v1/claim-snapshots` resolves explicit issue
selectors or an owner-wide set under one mutex, returning service time for the
CLI's once-computed absolute expiry. Public `GET /v1/claims?owner_client_id=...`
and `GET /v1/issues/<id>/claim` expose live authority; null is an explicit result.

`recordTransaction` adds live policy after structural/revision validation and
before writes. Its optional token arguments do not enter canonical intent or
history. `Prepared.RequiredClaims` reports current ownership or eligibility for
a transaction-only reservation; the CLI forwards same-client tokens through
`DurableRequest.Claims`. A formerly unclaimed issue may reuse a current same-client
claim, while supplied stale tokens never get replaced silently. Link mutations
must forward prepared tokens just like other durable mutations.

The policy covers explicit existing issues, changed indirect issue owners, and
existing comment owners. Comment append alone is exempt. Structural guards and
historical semantic replay remain independent of live ownership. No persisted
transient lease is needed because the mutex spans validation and journal commit.
Closing and explicit force append claim-release writes to the durable journal;
disconnect appends all owned live/expired releases to the client-state journal.
Claim changes alone do not increment durable revisions or create object history.

Excessive absolute renewal targets are rejected (user-confirmed), preserving the one-hour
grant cap and exact-request retry semantics. Acquisition separately caps excessive
absolute targets at one hour, retaining its 30-minute default. Duplicate/older targets on a live
matching claim remain no-ops, even when the requested target is now in the past.

Current issue reads project live `claim`/`claimed` outside the durable schema.
Claim lists support owner/issue filters and query-bound cursors, acquisition-time
(`created_at`) ordering with issue UUID ties, direction and bounded all-results
reads. Owner-wide renewal still uses a complete atomic claim snapshot.

## Links and discovery

Ticket 04 extends typed member deltas with optional `blocks`, `blocked_by`, and
`related` UUID sets. Public link/unlink preparation normalizes each logical edge
into mirrored endpoint operations, so inverse spellings and duplicate identical
edges produce the same canonical hash. Ordinary issue update inputs use the
link/unlink commands for relationship changes. The shared final-state engine
validates mirrors, endpoint existence, self links, and blocking cycles before
producing any writes. Both endpoint revisions participate, and structural guards
include reachable blocking paths. Parentage and blocker state remain independent.

`logicalMutationCount` counts each normalized logical edge once and each ordinary
record operation once; endpoint expansion is separately capped by the expanded
record bound. This preserves the advertised explicit limit at direct execution
without counting the mirror as a second user mutation. Preparation additionally
bounds input groups. Existing version-1 history and canonical fixtures retain
identical bytes because the new members are omitted when absent.

All durable lists now use `recordPage`: scope, AND-combined structured filters,
Unicode-normalized casefolded substring matching, inclusive-after/exclusive-before
times, deterministic sort/UUID ordering, and cursors bound to normalized queries.
`all` remains one bounded snapshot, never a page loop. Nullable parent/assignee
JSON filters use null for absence; the literal string `none` remains a real name,
while CLI `--assignee none` and URL `assignee=none` select absence.

## Interrupted-request reconciliation

The CLI provides `lit transactions status [--file PATH] [--session NAME]`.
With no scope flag it examines all retained private requests; an explicit session
filters by the mapping's service/client identity. `--endpoint` can reach that
same service at a new address but cannot change the retained identity. A supplied
file is evidence only and is never deleted. Existing version-1 pending envelopes
remain readable unchanged; there is no saved-plan or repair format.

`POST /v1/transaction-status` is a read-only serialized observation of an exact
`protocol.ReconcileRequest`. It accepts disconnected clients for reconciliation,
without permitting them to mutate. Its response binds service, client, and a
SHA-256 digest of that request (a transport proof binding, not a persisted receipt
or durable request hash). The CLI validates these bindings and the typed result
against the original request before discarding private evidence.

- `committed` / `immutable_history`: a matching durable hash in any proposed
  changed owner's immutable history proves the atomic change. Later edits do
  not invalidate that proof. The response includes the whole changed-owner set.
- `already_satisfied` / `current_validated_state`: the exact no-op passes original
  revisions, guards, ownership and token conditions. No history is invented.
  A matching live claim token whose expiry already reaches the absolute target
  can satisfy renewal; its expiry is never recomputed. Empty-token release with
  no active claim is a validated no-op.
- Client desired state at its original revision or exact one-step successor can
  establish `already_satisfied`; the successor uses `current_state` proof. This
  says the requested effect is present, not which request wrote it. Later client
  revisions, reconnect, or incompatible state remain uncertain.
- `uncommitted` is a serialized snapshot conclusion. For durable changes it
  requires misses in every proposed changed owner's history plus valid original
  preconditions and an actual remaining change. A matching live claim token below
  the requested renewal target, or still present for release, also establishes a
  missing effect. This observation cannot promise that an already delayed network
  request will never arrive later; it never authorizes a fresh semantic mutation.
- `uncertain` retains evidence and makes the status command exit 4 with structured
  `items` on stdout. Acquisition without a received token, replaced/expired
  ownership, and nonempty-token release after the claim disappears cannot prove
  historical outcomes. First registration without its returned client ID remains
  unidentifiable; status never registers a replacement or invents a mapping.

Ordinary commands attempt the same read-only reconciliation within their original
network deadline after an uncertain response. Proven history/no-op results can be
returned without another mutation request. A definitely uncommitted observation
returns `mutation_uncommitted` (exit 1); unresolved uncertainty remains exit 4.
Corrupt local evidence fails closed, malformed success/error/proof responses retain
it, and no startup or status path replays a mutation. Private per-request OS locks
span transmission and automatic reconciliation, preventing another status process
from removing evidence while that CLI still owns the request. Lock files live
under `locks/pending/`, separately from versioned pending JSON.


## Current storage growth limitation

The external-change fence scans and hashes authoritative store files, including
immutable history, before routing requests under the service mutex. Commit paths
perform another check. Startup also reconstructs and validates retained history.
Consequently read latency and startup time can grow with total retained data and
history, even for a request about one issue. This is a correctness-first initial
implementation, not a measured scalability guarantee; no large-store throughput
benchmark has been accepted. Preserve the fence and history checks when profiling
or designing an optimization rather than disabling them to gain speed.

See [recovery limitations](../recovery.md) for uncertainty that retained evidence
cannot currently resolve; no human repair or retirement interface is shipped.
